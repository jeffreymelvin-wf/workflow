Meetings
===============================
[Back to Team Agreement](README.md)

In general during a meeting practice good listening skills, stay attentive (laptops / phones down unless necessary), and come prepared.  Any/all meetings should have a clear agenda, a facilitator/owner/leader, and outcomes.  The facilitator should also identify potential next steps and assign owners for any followup tasks needed.  Below are a list of reoccuring and ad-hoc type of meetings.

## Reoccuring Meetings

* Standups - <15 minute daily meeting to quickly touchbase with the team(s) and review:
   * What was worked on the previous work day?
   * What will be tackled today?
   * What if/any blockers exist?
* Review - ~1hr meeting after each sprint to "review" what work was accomplished (includes demo's etc...)
* Stakeholder - ~1hr meeting after each sprint/review with leadership and stakeholders to discuss major items of interest
* Grooming - ~45min meeting to determine what individual tickets are needed for a specific feature / line of work
* Planning - ~45min meeting prior to the start of a sprint to bring "groomed" tickets into a sprint.  This exercise also involves pointing the ticket based on level of effort, so the team's capacity (amount of work they can take on) is taken into account.
* Retro - ~45min meeting set aside to assess what went well, what didn't go well, and next steps

## Ad-hoc meetings

Debate vs Decision meeting ideas plucked from 'Radical Candor' - Chapter 8 - Results:

* "Big Debate" - A meeting setup to debate (go figure) a particular topic.  It is not expected to make a decision.  Reserved for debate, but not decisions, on major issues facing the team.
   * Lowers tension - when everybody knows that the meeting will end with no decision, this tension (decide vs debate) is allievated.
   * Slows down key decisions when appropriate
   * Fosters a larger culture of debate
* "Big Decision" - Push decisions into the facts, pull facts into the decisions, and keep egos at bay
   * Typically follow a big debate meeting
   * Serves two important roles - 1) make important decisions   2) Marks when to stop debating and start deciding
