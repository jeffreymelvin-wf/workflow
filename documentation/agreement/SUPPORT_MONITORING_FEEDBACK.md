Support / Monitoring / Feedback
===============================
[Back to Team Agreement](README.md)

Note:  It is assumed support/monitoring are required when in production, but not during prototype phase.  Feedback is always welcome, especially during the prototype phase.

## Support Methodology

* Support Squad (rotating on-call schedule):
   * An internal support team is created every 2 weeks to 1 month.
      * These resources are still members of a squad working on OKRs during this time. These team members balance support triage with future development of CDS.  The support group is not necessarily the developers fixing the issue, unless severity warrants it.  
   * The support group is comprised of 1 support group lead, 1 client side developer, 1 server side developer, 1 QA/SDET, 1 backup and the DMs.
   * Refer to the [Documents Support](https://docs.sandbox.wdesk.com/a/QWNjb3VudB8yMDAx/document/V0ZEYXRhRW50aXR5HjEzNzEwNDQ2OTU4MzIzMjg/anchor/549755813896) document for more details.

## Monitoring

* Set up appropriate dashboards and alerts on all services/products in various environments (production, sandbox, etc…)

## Feedback

* Have a mechanism (email feedback button) to allow internal and external users to submit feedback
* Have a standing recurring meeting to groom these feedback tickets
* Feed this Back… into the PM process
