[Back to Team Agreement](README.md)

## Process

* Quarterly OKRs drive top level objective
* Pre-grooming breaks OKR’s into Epics, Stories, Tasks - [see presentation](https://docs.google.com/a/webfilings.com/presentation/d/1CLLylJYvyRyOO4pxvMH3KdpPZSwMWZdjs_lBE3JBcjg/edit?usp=sharing)
   * Every Team Gantt (TG) incremental KR should have a corresponding JIRA Epic
   * Every TG deliverable should have a corresponding JIRA Story
   * Every JIRA Story needs at least one Subtask
   * Team Gantt and JIRA should always reflect the same structure - if you change one, change both!
* Grooming evaluates the level of effort for each task
   * 1 point = 1 day of focus from a dev/QA 
* Planning brings “groomed” work into the sprint
