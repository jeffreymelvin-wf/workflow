User Experience
===============================
[Back to Team Agreement](README.md)

The User Experience of Wdesk is everyone’s responsibility. 

## What Engineering Can Expect from UX

* Clarity on what user facing problem we are trying to solve, including who the primary users are and their existing pain points.
* Collaborative creation and validation of the best solution for the Wdesk ecosystem, within existing technical constraints. 
* The UXer collaborates with other teams to ensure ecosystem consistency and a solution that scales.
* Specifications for the solution. The amount of detail will vary depending on the complexity of the solution. Specifications may include:
   * Mockups of screens and states.
   * Gifs or screencasts of behaviors
   * Link to interactive prototypes of behaviors 
   * Indication of which WebSkin icons, components and style variations to use
   * Written description of behaviors and states
   * Visual specification of WebSkin classes and any needed custom styles (custom 
styles should be last resort)

## What UX Expects from Engineering

* Have a discussion with UX as new constraints or edge cases arise. New information is important to be aware of and agree to a resolution. 
Times when this is especially important:
   * When a solution needs to be further broken up into iterations to get to the final solution
   * When a solution is going to take far more work than estimated
   * When a solution that was previously discarded now seems more feasible
   * If a previously unconsidered solution, especially one that may be technically easier, occurs to you
   * If during testing you feel like an experience isn’t as polished as prototypes
   * When a previously unconsidered error or edge case crops up (especially if there is a user facing error)
* @mention UXers on PRs that include UX work
   * The earlier you can show something to your UXer, the fewer surprises will crop up just before trying to release.
   * Allows the UXer to preview either a
      * Ngrok
      * Deployment to a sandbox URL
      * Screenshot / Screen capture
   * The UXer can then verify the AC was met to the spec previously delivered and provide a `UX +1`
